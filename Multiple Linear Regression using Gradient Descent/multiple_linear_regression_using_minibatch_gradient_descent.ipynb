    "### Mini-Batch Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to minimize the **cost function**.  \n",
    "It mainly comes in three variants — **Batch**, **Stochastic**, and **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧮 1. Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "In Batch Gradient Descent, we use the **entire dataset** to compute the gradient and update the parameters in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**  \n",
    "- Computation becomes **very slow** for large datasets.  \n",
    "- High **memory usage**, since the entire dataset is processed at once.  \n",
    "- Can get stuck in **local minima** and convergence can be slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚡ 2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)\n",
    "In SGD, the parameters are updated after computing the gradient for **each individual data point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems:**  \n",
    "- Frequent updates make the convergence **noisy**.  \n",
    "- The cost function fluctuates in a **zig-zag** pattern.  \n",
    "- It may take longer to reach a stable minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ⚙️ 3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "Mini-Batch Gradient Descent combines the best of both worlds —  \n",
    "the **efficiency** of SGD and the **stability** of Batch Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into small batches (for example, 16, 32, or 64 samples per batch).  \n",
    "For each iteration, the average gradient of one batch is used to update the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**  \n",
    "- Faster computation than Batch Gradient Descent.  \n",
    "- Smoother convergence compared to SGD.  \n",
    "- Well-suited for **GPU parallelization**.  \n",
    "- Provides a good **balance** between stability and efficiency.\n"
