    "## 🧠 Problems with Batch Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) is conceptually simple and mathematically accurate,  \n",
    "but it has several **practical limitations** when dealing with large datasets or real-time learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ 1. High Computational Cost\n",
    "- In every epoch, BGD calculates the gradient using **all training samples**.\n",
    "- This requires performing a full pass through the entire dataset before a single update.\n",
    "- As the dataset grows, the time to compute each update increases drastically.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧮 Example:\n",
    "If the dataset has 1 million rows,  \n",
    "one gradient update means processing all 1 million samples → **very slow convergence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 2. High Memory Usage\n",
    "- Since all data points are required at once,  \n",
    "  the entire dataset must fit into **memory (RAM)** during training.\n",
    "- For very large datasets, this becomes infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ Real-world datasets (e.g., terabytes of data) cannot be loaded into memory completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐢 3. Slow Convergence\n",
    "- BGD updates weights **only once per epoch**,  \n",
    "  meaning it waits until all samples are processed before improving the model.\n",
    "- This leads to **delayed learning** — the model doesn’t start improving until the full dataset is seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 4. Stuck in Local Minima (for Non-Convex Problems)\n",
    "- Because it uses the **exact average gradient**,  \n",
    "  the optimization path is very smooth and deterministic.\n",
    "- This can cause the model to get stuck in **local minima** or flat regions of the loss surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚡ 5. Not Suitable for Online / Streaming Data\n",
    "- In real-time applications (like stock prediction, sensor data, or live user inputs),  \n",
    "  data arrives continuously.\n",
    "- BGD cannot handle such situations because it requires **all data upfront**  \n",
    "  before starting any update.\n",

    "### 🧩 Overview\n",
    "**Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function and find the best model parameters.  \n",
